Bins
=============

Description
-------------
The rabbits left a mess in their cage.
```
  //    //                    //
 ('>   ('>    LX2gkn81        ('>
 /rr   /rr       carrots      /rr
*\))_ *\))_                  *\))_
```
If only I knew which bin to put the rubbish in.


Hint
-------------
Don't try to interpret or decode the strings.

You just need to find the right place.
