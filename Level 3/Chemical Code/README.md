Description
-------------
Our crazy chemistry professor wrote a secret code on the blackboard:

`9 57 32 10 111 39 85 8 115 8 16 42 16`

He also mumbled something like "essential and elementary knowledge".

lowercase only, no spaces
wrap into `he2023{` and `}`

Hint
-------------
You must use the English version.


Solution
-------------
This one is pretty simple. Each number is a chemical element on the Periodic Table.
Just write down the symbol for each element.
