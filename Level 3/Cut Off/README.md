Description
-------------
I had a secret Easter egg on my screenshot, but I cropped it, hehe!

Kudos to former Hacky Easter winner [Retr0id](https://twitter.com/David3141593) - he's one of the researches who found the vulnerability in question!


Hint
-------------
The screenshot was taken on a Pixel 6 without the latest security updates.


Solution
-------------
This image is vulnerable to the Acropalypse exploit.
Go [here](https://acropalypse.app) and upload `screenshot.png` with Pixel 6 as the device type to reveal the QR code that was cropped out.
Scan the code to get the flag.
