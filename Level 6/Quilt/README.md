Quilt
=============

Difficulty: medium

Tags: misc

Description
-------------
A warm, sunny day - perfect weather for a picnic! But what's that - did the bunnies really bring the nice quilt from the living room as a blanket?


Hint
-------------
Cut a beautiful quilt like this into pieces? A shame, but maybe necessary!


Solution
-------------
Each QR code in this “quilt” is a letter.
Scanning each one would be a pain, so it’s fairly straight forward to write a script to read them for you.

Here's a [Python script](./example_solution/quilt.py) that does just that.
